## OVERVIEW
This project analyzes long-term NFL team performance using SQL, focused on wins, scoring, point differential, efficiency, and consistency.

## CURRENT PROGRESS
Day 1: A 'team_seasons' CTE containing core season-level metrics was built. Performance vs. expected performance columns were created to compare a team's win/loss percentage to expected performance. Using the Pythagorean model, expected performance is calculated based on point totals for a given season. 

Day 2: Teams were ranked by wins and points within its respective division, conference, and the entire NFL. Some teams may be out of place due to not accounting for tiebreakers.

## NEXT STEPS
[X] Add season rankings using window functions.

[] Generate group-level aggregates to reveal division and league trends.

[] Build era-based summaries to compare offensive and defensive trends over time.

[] Add opponent-adjusted efficiency metrics to show how teams perform relative to league norms.

[] Evaluate team consistency using multi-year performance variability.

[] Segment team performance based on opponent strength categories.

[] Prepare clean, analysis-ready tables for visualization.

[] Build dashboards that visualize trends, comparisons, and performance insights.

[] Document project insights, methodology, and technical skills used.
